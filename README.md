# Unikraft at Google Summer of Code

This repository contains the official archive of the Unikraft GSoC projects over the years.

## File hierarchy

Browse the files to investigate what work was done every year, expectations, ideas and more:

```
gsoc/
|---gsoc-year/
|   |---ideas.md
|   |---README.md
|   |---work-product/
|   |   |---Name-Project/
|---README.md
|---work-product-template.md
```

Let's take a tour of what every file in this hierarchy means:

* For every year, we provided an updated list of ideas that should inspire you decide what you'd like to work on during summer, the `ideas.md` file.
You can choose from there or you can come up with your own idea; nevertheless, get involved with the community and debate on your project.

* The `README.md` inside the yearly directory contains information specific to the year we are participating in GSoC: general code of conduct, the proposal template and what is expected of you **before** being accepted as a contributor.

* Now, onto the `work-product` directory: this is the place where we document what our contributors have worked on during the summer, their progress and more.
It's also where you will post your work (if you are going to be accepted as a contributor) and it will be what your mentor will revise before giving their final feedback.

* The main `README.md` is what you are reading now: fun stuff!

* The last piece of the puzzle is the `work-product-template.md` file.
It contains the skeleton that accepted contributors use for their final submission.

## Best practices

First and foremost, read the `README.md` file for the year you are applying in.
Follow the steps documented there as closly as possible: you (literally) get extra points.

Inspect `ideas.md`.
Get involved with the community regarding your project idea!

Take a glance at the `work-product` directory: know what to expect after the summer ends, what previous mentees had to do and their involvement with Unikraft.

Write your proposal, you'll find the template linked in the `README.md` for the year you are applying in.

Submit your proposal and good luck!
